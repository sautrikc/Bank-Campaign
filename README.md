This code contains all the code as a part of Winter in Data Science. I used data visualization to analyse the data and gain key insights into the input features. Following this, various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors & Decision Trees. Further XGBoost was applied for boosting and final a final F1 score of 0.94 was obtained.
